## Classification of organoids differentiating into the retina of the eye by deep learning with data preprocessing

### Project Description:

Stem pluripotent cells are capable of creating retinal-like structures called organoids. However, the differentiation of stem cells into retinal neurons does not always succeed. To assess the quality of differentiation as early as the 6th day after its initiation, a Bright-Field method implemented through machine learning is used.

In this project, the deep learning neural network was employed to implement this algorithm. An artificial neuron functions similarly to a real neuron: each neuron in the hidden layer has a value ranging from 0 to 1. Neurons receive input values from previous neurons, sum them, and multiply them by weights. To determine the optimal weights and minimize errors, the neural network needs to be trained on a large amount of input data.

### Goal: 

To create an optimized neural network that accurately predicts the quality of organoid differentiation in the early stages of development.

### Objectives:

1. Review the literature on pluripotent stem cells, including key discoveries related to their study and the application of machine learning methods in medicine and science to simplify their study.
2. Study the fundamental methods of deep learning and the essential libraries required for the project (matplotlib, pillow, numpy, scipy, pytorch, openCV).
3. Utilize the acquired knowledge to write and train a neural network on preprocessed data.
4. Evaluate the accuracy of the neural network's performance on data obtained from the laboratory and draw appropriate conclusions.

For image analysis, a specialized type of neural network called a convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed.
